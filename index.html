  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p class="about_me">
    I am a final-year Computer Science student, eagerly anticipating the transition from academia to the professional 
    realm as a software engineer. My journey into the world of technology began in early 2022 when I developed a keen interest in 
    programming, with a focus on Python and web development. In November of the same year, I committed to furthering my education, 
    embarking on a Bachelor's degree in computer science.

    <br><br>

    Throughout my academic tenure, I have actively applied my knowledge by crafting various applications, 
    all of which are accessible on my GitHub page. Soon, these projects will be featured on my portfolio page, 
    providing a comprehensive overview of my skills and accomplishments. As I approach graduation, 
    I am poised to contribute my passion for coding and technology to a dynamic career in software engineering.
