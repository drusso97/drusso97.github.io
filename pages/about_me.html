<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p class="about_me">
    I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and am excited to begin my career as a software 
    engineer. My interest in programming started in early 2022, focusing on Python and web development. 
    Later that year, I committed to deepening my skills by pursuing a degree in computer science, which
     has provided me with a strong foundation in both backend and frontend development.

    <br><br>

    Throughout my studies, I worked on several hands-on projects that are available on my GitHub, and I'm
     in the process of building a portfolio to showcase them. Now that I've graduated, I'm ready to bring 
     my passion for coding and problem-solving to a full-time role in software engineering, eager to 
     contribute to a growing team and continue learning along the way.
